# What are two differences between NodeJS and browser runtimes?

* NodeJS runtime has the fs and readline modules. Browser runtime has a window object, a location object, and a document object.
* Gold-standard documentation differs as well: see nodejs.org for node; see developer.mozilla.org for browser.
